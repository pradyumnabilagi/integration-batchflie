# integration-batchflie
for this program to run double click on the batch file named runer.bat.
and also you must have D drive for this program to work,
please don't close the command prompt by clicking on its close button on its toolbar ,once you get the answer just press any key the window will close itself, if you are not getting answer at all you can close the prompt but after that you will see a new folder will be created in your D drive named 'backupforrunner' in which there mostly will be two files one will be main.c file and other will be output.exe file so you can delete them by yourself.
note:don't rename anything and don't seperate the .exe from the batch file.
